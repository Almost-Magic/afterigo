Structure the prep as:

### This Week at a Glance

**Top 3 Priorities**
- The three things that will make this week successful
- Based on Gravity Engine critical items, deadlines, and strategic goals

**Hard Deadlines**
- Anything that cannot slip this week (commits, launches, payments, meetings)

**Meetings Requiring Prep**
- External meetings only (skip internal syncs)
- For each: who, their context, what they likely want, what to prepare
- Flag any where Mani might be underprepared

**Follow-Ups Owed**
- People Mani owes a response or deliverable to
- Sorted by urgency

**Flags and Risks**
- Scheduling conflicts or overloaded days
- Projects that look like they might slip
- Dependencies on other people

**Deep Work Blocks**
- Recommend specific time blocks for focused work based on calendar gaps
- Suggest what to work on during each block

**Last Week's Scorecard**
- Key metrics: content performance, CRM activity, tool uptime
- What went well, what didn't

Keep to one page. Bullet points are fine here — this is a reference document, not a narrative. Australian English.
